# Problem 271A: Beautiful Year - Code Explanation

This code is written in C and solves the problem of finding the next beautiful year greater than the given year. A beautiful year is defined as a year where all the digits are distinct, meaning no two digits in the year are the same.

### Problem Description
A year will be called a beautiful year if the digits (no two digits are the same) are distinct. Given a year `y`, find the next beautiful year greater than `y`.


## Input

The input consists of a single integer `y` (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.

## Output

Print a single integer — the minimum beautiful year greater than `y`.

## Code Explanation

The code performs the following steps:

1. The function `hasDistinctDigits` is defined, which takes an integer `year` as input and returns 1 if the digits are distinct and 0 otherwise.

2. Inside the `hasDistinctDigits` function, an integer array `digits` of size 10 is initialized to store the occurrence of each digit. All elements are set to 0 initially.

3. A while loop is used to iterate until the year is greater than 0.

4. Inside the loop, the last digit of the year is obtained using the modulus operator and stored in the variable `digit`.

5. The `digit` is checked against the `digits` array to determine if it has already occurred. If the digit is found to be repeated (i.e., `digits[digit]` is 1), the function returns 0, indicating that the digits are not distinct.

6. If the digit is distinct, it is marked as occurred by setting `digits[digit]` to 1.

7. The year is divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

8. After checking all the digits, if no repeated digit is found, the function returns 1, indicating that the digits are distinct.

9. In the `main` function, an integer variable `y` is read from the input using `scanf`.

10. The variable `nextYear` is initialized as `y + 1`.

11. A while loop is used to find the next beautiful year. It repeatedly increments `nextYear` and checks if it has distinct digits by calling the `hasDistinctDigits` function. The loop continues until a beautiful year is found.

12. Once a beautiful year is found, it is printed using `printf`.


## Example

**Input:**
- `1987`

**Output:**
- `2013`
