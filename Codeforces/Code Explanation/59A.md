# Problem 59A: Word - Code Explanation

This code is written in C and solves the problem of converting a word to either all lowercase or all uppercase letters, depending on which case is more dominant in the word.

## Code Explanation

The code performs the following steps:

1. It declares a character array `word` with a maximum size of 101 to store the input word.

2. It prompts the user to enter a word by printing "Enter a word: ".

3. It reads the word input by the user using `scanf` and stores it in the `word` array.

4. Two integer variables, `uppercaseCount` and `lowercaseCount`, are initialized to 0. These variables will be used to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the word.

5. A loop is used to iterate through each character of the word. The loop continues until the null character `\0` is encountered, indicating the end of the string.

6. Inside the loop, each character of the word is checked using conditional statements.

   - If the character is in the range of uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z'), the `uppercaseCount` is incremented.

   - If the character is in the range of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'), the `lowercaseCount` is incremented.

7. After counting the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, the code determines the corrected word based on the counts.

   - If `uppercaseCount` is greater than `lowercaseCount`, it means the word has more uppercase letters. In this case, another loop is used to convert each lowercase letter in the word to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value.

   - If `uppercaseCount` is less than or equal to `lowercaseCount`, it means the word has either more lowercase letters or an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters. In this case, another loop is used to convert each uppercase letter in the word to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value.

8. Finally, the corrected word is printed using `printf`.

## Example

**Input:**
Enter a word: HoUse

**Output:**
