# Problem 71A: Way Too Long Words - Code Explanation

This code is written in C and solves the problem of abbreviating long words. The problem requires abbreviating words longer than 10 characters by replacing the middle characters with the count of omitted characters.

## Problem Description

Given a list of words, the task is to abbreviate the words longer than 10 characters. For each word, if its length is greater than 10, the abbreviation should consist of the first character, followed by the count of omitted characters in between, and the last character of the word. If a word has a length of 10 or less, it remains unchanged.

## Input

The input consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of words, followed by `n` lines containing the words.

## Output

Print the abbreviations of the words, according to the rules mentioned above.

## Code Explanation

The code performs the following steps:

1. Inside the `main` function, an integer variable `n` is read from the input using `scanf`. It represents the number of words.

2. A loop is used to iterate `n` times, each time reading a word from the input using `scanf`.

3. Inside the loop, an integer variable `length` is initialized to 0. It will be used to calculate the length of the current word.

4. A while loop is used to count the length of the word. It iterates until the null character `'\0'` is encountered, indicating the end of the word.

5. After counting the length, an `if-else` condition is used to determine whether the word needs abbreviation.

6. If the length is greater than 10, the code prints the abbreviation. It uses `printf` with a formatted string to output the first character of the word, followed by the count of omitted characters (`length - 2`), and finally, the last character of the word.

7. If the length is 10 or less, the code simply prints the word as it is using `printf`.

8. After processing all the words, the loop in `main` ends, and the program exits.

## Example

**Input:**
`4
word
localization
internationalization
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis`

**Output:**
`word
l10n
i18n
p43s`
